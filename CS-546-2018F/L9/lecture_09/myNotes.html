<!--The DOM is a programming interface for HTML.
◦ The rendering engine takes in the HTML document
◦ The rendering engine parse the HTML into the DOM tree
◦ The rendering engine takes the DOM tree and creates the render tree
◦ The rendering engine paints the render tree
-->
<!--You can then manipulate the web page through the DOM, 
which is accessible via JavaScript.
◦ You will target DOM elements
◦ You will manipulate them
◦ The rendering engine will recreate that portion of the rendering tree.
◦ The rendering engine will repaint.
-->
<!--Thus, we can
◦ Enhance the functionality of your web page
◦ Update data on your web page to reflect the user’s actions
◦ Turn web pages into robust web applications 
-->
<!--For example:
You are creating a page with a comment box and list of comments. 
You’ve created a very controversial post that will definitely spawn 
a large amount of comments. You would manipulate the DOM in three ways:
◦ Every 5 seconds you would poll the server in order to check for new 
comments; if there are new comments, you would use the DOM to create and 
insert new elements with the comment info that would then appear on screen
◦ When the user submits a comment, you will use the DOM to:
◦ Retrieve their new comment information, submit it to the server, 
and add their new comment to the page
◦ Reset the comment box form to its default state
-->
<!--Some common events to listen to are:
◦ Users hovering over an element
◦ Images loading or failing to load
◦ Scrolling to occur
◦ Forms to be interacted with
◦ Keys to be pressed
◦ The DOM to be modified.
