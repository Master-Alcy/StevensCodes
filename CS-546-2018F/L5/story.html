            <h3>Op-Amp’s open-loop transfer characteristic</h3>
            <p>
                Build a voltage divider with potentiometer and side resistors to obtain variable input voltage in the
                range of approximately +-11 V. Explore an open-loop Op-Amp without a negative feedback: connect divider
                output to the <em>non-inverting</em> (+) input of the Op-Amp, and connect the inverting (–) input to the ground;
                later reverse these connections. By slowly adjusting divider voltage near its zero value, find the
                voltages at which the output switches between +-11 V <em>(the actual corner voltages are too small to be
                detect; you will obtain upper bounds will be much larger than those expected corner voltages)</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try to observe random oscilloscope switching between ± 14 V occurring when potentiometer output voltage
                is close to zero, VD ≈ 0, and try to explain the cause of these oscillations in the Report. The output
                oscillating between +14V and -14V when the input D has the boundary voltages in Table 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                The random oscillations when potentiometer voltage is close to zero is most likely caused by the very
                small oscillating of the DC power source’s output voltages. The oscillating is so small that normally
                we cannot detect it, but when VD≈0, the slope between -14V and +14V is so large that it makes the very
                small oscillation visible. The slope is shown in fig. 5. The slope also shows that the gain of the
                Op-Amp in open loop is <strong>extremely</strong> high.
            </p>
            <h3>Using open loop Op-Amp to produce adjustable-amplitude square wave</h3>
            <p>
                Connect Op-Amp as shown in the Figure below, with SG supplying an AC signal (which can be sinusoidal or
                triangular) to the non-inverting (+) input, while the inverting input is grounded. At the output there
                is a potentiometer (adjustable voltage divider) which allows to adjust the resulting square wave
                amplitude: <strong><em>etc...</em></strong>
