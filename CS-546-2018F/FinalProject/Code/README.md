# Base Root for all Codes

Data folder is moved to ./server/data for clearer purpose.

## Some Commands

Install Environment:  
npm install

Install bundle.js:  
npm run react-dev  
After Build done, ctrl + c exist.

Start server/index.js (our main):  
npm start  

### For Development

Use nodemon:  
npm run server-dev  

Use webpack:  
npm run react-dev  

For development, it's easier to use both nodemon and webpack.
