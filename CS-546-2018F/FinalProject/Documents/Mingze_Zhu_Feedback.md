# LS Project Feedback(v1.0 12/06)

1. User can register into the system as student and staff with a same username. In this case, if user relog into the system again, he can only be determined as a student.
2. Maybe we should include a user guide on the webpage or personal account, since it is not easy to access the functions on this website.(e.g I don't know how to rent a book, therefor I cannot check if the rentle record function can run properly.)
3. Also, maybe we need update the Readme file since people need to type npm run react-dev to run the project at the first time.
