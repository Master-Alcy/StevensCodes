## Developement Update (V1.0 12/6)

1. Now, passwords shown as dots
2. The user can use anyname to become student or staff. The only thing matters is the passwords. Like that would be common in a university to have both a student and a staff named Max, Marry. However, it does confusing when rendering records. Thus, I fixed this.
3. README.md updated. I uploaded the bundle.js used to run client, thus, now we dont need to run npm run react-dev before testing.
4. insturctions added.
