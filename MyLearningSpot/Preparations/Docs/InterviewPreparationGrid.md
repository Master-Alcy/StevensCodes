### Weaknesses

* I don't have enough exprience in giving people with different technology backgroup with reasonable work. This result in my overloading myself in project and people who want to learn don't get enough chance. I've learned to seperate a large project into small chuncks of work with differnt techonology requirement and I believe I can do better in the future.
* I only have simple DataBase and multi-threading experience, and lack of that for a large usage in big company's workflow. I have started working on that with reading tech-blogs of others.
* I write everything like a lab report, which is from my education. I'm not good at writing fancy words but I do good at making graphs.

### Good At

* I learn fast.
* Tend to fullfill requirements in every detail.
* Love to and have studied to write clean code.
