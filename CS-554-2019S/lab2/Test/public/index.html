Besides, Metro's story is great. You'll want to know what's happening before you see what Exodus has in store.</p><p>And you'll definitely want to pick up Metro: Exodus, at least if the game's pre-release materials are telling the truth. For one, you're no longer confined to the subway tunnels. With Exodus, the Metro series is going semi-open world with levels 10 times bigger than those found in Last Light. Every stage will offers hours worth of things to do — if you can manage to survive, of course. In Metro: Exodus, you'll need to carefully manage your supplies, craft your own weapons, and be very, very careful if you want to survive a full year in the Russian nuclear winter.</p><p>As per series tradition, radioactive mutants will return, but really, it's Metro's world that has us jazzed. A dynamic weather system and real-time day-to-night cycle look like they'll help make Metro: Exodus one of the most convincing post-apocalyptic settings of all time. It's everything you loved about Metro before. You'll just have more freedom to do what you want. A whole lot more.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div></div><!--End of card-group--><div id="card-2" class="card-group col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-4" style="width: fit-content; height:fit-content;"><div class="card text-dark bg-light mb-3"><img src="images/Crackdown.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="card-img-top"><div class="card-header"><h3 class="card-title">Crackdown 3</h3><h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Out on Feb. 15</h6></div><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">Crackdown 3 might've missed 2018, but Feb. 15 isn't too far off.

Even better.</p><p>This time, though, crime bosses won't take your assaults lying down. Thanks to Crackdown 3's dynamic "Gangs Bite Back" system, enemies will send out strike teams to take you out, or fortify besieged buildings to keep you at bay.

On the other, that means the game has been delayed until 2019, and BioWare's got a lot riding on it. Rumors suggest that if Anthem doesn't deliver, BioWare as we know it may cease to exist.</p><p>That's a lot of pressure, especially for a studio best known for role-playing games, not loot-based shooters. Still, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Anthem will pit players, known as Freelancers, against giant both monsters and also "world-altering" natural threats like so-called Shaper Storms. Players' super-suits, also called Javelins, will be upgradable, and come in a number of different styles that dictate characters' classes.</p><p>There's room for a good multiplayer shared-world shooter, too, given that The Division lost most of its players shortly after launch and that Destiny 2 is suffering from its own set of problems. Anthem is far from a sure thing, but BioWare is committed to the franchise long-term, and despite some recent disappointments they've delivered the goods before. Cross your fingers, and hope for the best.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div></div><!--End of card-group--><div id="card-4" class="card-group col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-4" style="width: fit-content; height:fit-content;"><div class="card text-dark bg-light mb-3"><img src="images/DeadorAlive6.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="card-img-top"><div class="card-header"><h3 class="card-title">Dead or Alive 6</h3><h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Out on March 1</h6></div><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">For better or worse, Dead or Alive has a reputation for focusing more on scantily-clad babes than actual fighting.</p></div><div class="card-footer"><button type="button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-4">More on this</button> <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Back to top</a></div></div><div class="modal fade" id="modal-4" tabindex="1" role="dialog"><div class="modal-dialog" role="document"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><h5 class="modal-title">More on Dead or Alive 6</h5><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button></div><div class="modal-body"><p>With Dead or Alive 6, that's changing.

That's what ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove promises it'll deliver. ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove will play like the alien MC's original adventure: an isometric perspective, bizarre power-ups that can hurt just as much as they help, ever-changing levels, and a wicked sense of humor.</p><p>ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove should be an authentic ToeJam & Earl experience, too. The game was developed by series creator Greg Johnson's company, HumaNature Studios, and was funded by hardcore fans to the tune of $500,000. If you're too young to remember ToeJam & Earl, that should be all the encouragement you need to check this out — and for the rest of us, Back in the Groove is one blast from the past that shouldn't be missed.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-dismiss="modal">Close</button></div></div></div></div></div><!--End of card-group--><div id="card-6" class="card-group col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 col-xl-4" style="width: fit-content; height:fit-content;"><div class="card text-dark bg-light mb-3"><img src="images/TotalWar.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="card-img-top"><div class="card-header"><h3 class="card-title">Total War: Three Kingdoms</h3><h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Out on March 7</h6></div><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of China's Four Great Classical Novels, may not be that well known in the West, but it's an awfully popular foundation for video games nonetheless.</p></div><div class="card-footer"><button type="button" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal-6">More on this</button> <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Back to top</a></div></div><div class="modal fade" id="modal-6" tabindex="1" role="dialog"><div class="modal-dialog" role="document"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><h5 class="modal-title">More about Total War</h5><button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button></div><div class="modal-body"><p>In the mid-'80s, Koei produced a NES-bound adaptation of the same name that spawned 12 sequels, plus a handful of spin-offs. Dynasty Warriors, the crowd-based hack n' slash title, recreates many of the book's most notable battlesT. The classic PlayStation JRPG Suikoden 2 is a loose adaptation of the book. So is Atlantica Online and many others.</p><p>In March, add Total War to that list. Creative Assembly's popular strategy series has already visited locations like ancient Rome, medieval Europe, feudal Japan, and Warhammer's grim 'n' gritty fantasy world. Why not China's Three Kingdoms era? Don't let the new setting concern you, though. Total War: Three Kingdoms will still combine macro-level turn-based strategy with smaller-scale real-time battles that let you control the action directly. It's still Total War, after all.</p><p>Total War: Three Kingdoms will pay tribute to its literary roots, however. In Three Kingdoms, characters have their own personalities, and if you want to be an effective leader, you'll need to manage their personal wants and needs in addition to their positions on the battlefield. "We can't do the period justice without characters being at the forefront of the game," lead designer Simon Mann says.

It comes through in the odd and unsettling city of Oakdale, which has been left partially underwater after a battle between all-powerful gods. It appears in the 1920s timeline, which echoes the era in which Lovecraft wrote his best-known works. It's the way that the game plays with mysteries and how it forces regular people, like you, to become supernatural investigators.</p><p>As you search for clues and try to unravel Oakdale's many secrets, you won't find any pre-defined waypoints or a quest log that tells you where to go next.
