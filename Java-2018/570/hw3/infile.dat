aaa$%^&*()In Unit 3, we will learn I-V curves for ohmic and non-ohmic resistors, the I-V curve for a diode, load-line analysis, clipping circuit, rectifier circuit, transistor and ripple voltage.
We will use the ohm-law to learn about the I-V curve. The I-V curve is nothing but current vs. voltage. The resistance is therefore the inverse of the value of slope. The point of I vs. V but not V vs. I is that for a diode, the I-V curve shows its exponential trace more clearly. The one ground too many problem is introduced in Assignment 1, and also be used in Assignment 11.
This unit is all about diode. A diode is usually made in Si and formed by a p-n junction. The n-type contains lots of electrons while the p-type contains lots of positive charges. The detail of how p-n junction work is in Assignment 8. The diode itself have many interesting properties, too. Current can only go through a diode in one direction, all the reversed direction current would be blocked. Moreover, even the current goes in the right direction, the diode needs a certain voltage across it to actually open, in other words, it causes a voltage drop.
A clipping circuit is introduced in 123123123123 Assignment 5. The clipping provide a controllable limiting output. For a certain direction of the diode, the voltage drop is either positive, or negative. If we inverse the direction of the diode, the voltage drop inverses, too. The shape of the peak of the output curve is sometimes rounded, which is called rounded effect, introduced in Assignment 5.
A clipping circuit is first a resistor then a diode, a rectifier is in the opposite form. A rectifier is first a diode then a resistor. This relationship between the rectifier and clipping is similar to high pass filter and low pass filter. The output of the rectifier is over the resistor. The diode needs a particular voltage to open, so the output will act differently. Details in Assignment 7.
The transformer is explained in equipment addthisstring and experimental techniques. The ripple voltage is decided by the chosen smoothing capacitor. We can apply linear approximation to
